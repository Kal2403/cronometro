This project is a simple timer app that allows you to start, stop, and reset a timer using three buttons on a web page. It was created using [HTML], [CSS], and [JavaScript].

## Getting Started
To use the timer app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a timer displayed on the page with three buttons: **"Start"**, **"Stop"**, and **"Reset"**. Click the **"Start"** button to begin the timer, the **"Stop"** button to pause the timer, and the **"Reset"** button to reset the timer to zero.

## Interactive Functions
The timer app uses JavaScript to provide an interactive experience. The functions used to control the timer are:

    - start(): This function starts the timer counting up from zero.

    - stop(): This function stops the timer from counting.

    - reset(): This function resets the timer to zero.

These functions are called by the corresponding buttons on the web page using event listeners.
